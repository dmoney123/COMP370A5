Welcome to my first Data Science Project using an aws EC2.

This one is quite simple - using a kaggle api we downloaded a "clean_dialog" my little pony data set.

The objective is to first explore the data set using cmd line tools. This is very open ended and should give me more insight into the data set. (Explore.md)

We will then use "grep" tool to determine how often each main character (pony) speaks.

this project concludes with a 35 hour marathon of every my little pony episode.
